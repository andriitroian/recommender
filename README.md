# Recommender

To start project, first of all `mondog` daemon should be running.

1) Go to `/server` folder and run `npm run init` script in console to populate database with demo data
2) Go back to the root folder of the project and run `npm start` to start client side of the project

Login, password and some other demo data you could take from `server/init.js` file
